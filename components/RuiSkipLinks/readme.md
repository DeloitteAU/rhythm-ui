# Skip Links
Skip links provide an easy and acccessible way to jump to the main navigation or content of your site


## Using them
The skip links component provides links to the main and nav elements on the page. In order for this to function correctly you need to ensure your main and nav components have id's 'main' & 'nav' respectively.

Below the skip links are included, the links are hidden until they are focused - so tab through to the element to reveal the links 

```html
<rui-skip-links />
```
