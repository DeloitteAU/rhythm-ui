# Moderate: Using Create Shadow Styles Hook

The Create Shadow Styles Hook will let you completly customise the styles for our components.

The hook will enable you to write CSS normally but with allot more safety. The css is encapsulated only in the
components [shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom), so you donâ€™t have to worry about css collisions.

Example hook usage:

```js
import {css, createShadowStyles} from '@rhythm-ui/styles';

// Declare new CSS rules for a tags inside breadcrumbs
createShadowStyles({
	RuiBreadcrumbs: css`
		a {
			color: rebeccapurple;
		}

		a:hover {
			text-decoration: underline;
		}
	`,
});
```

Now when ever `<rui-breadcrumbs>` is rendered on the page it will automagically include the new css rules.

> Note: It's important that you create your shadow hooks before the components are defined (loaded)

**When would I use this Hook?** If you are theaming a component with css variables and realise you need to add some additional css to it.

## Declaring a create shadow style hook


To create a new hook you will need to first import `createShadowStyles` and `css` from the styles module. This should already be installed if you followed the 
getting started guide.

```js
import {css, createShadowStyles} from '@rhythm-ui/styles';
```

You must then call `createShadowStyles` with a object `{}` of key(s) that map to a component **class name** that you intend on customising.
There can be one or many.

The components *class name* can be found documented under the "styles" heading for each component.

The value must be a css template literal.

You can call `createShadowStyles` as many times as you like from multiple locations in your application. However component shadow styles will be overridden if the same key (class name) is declared twice.

**Example** - Multiple createShadowStyles with duplicate RuiButton keys

```js
import {css, createShadowStyles} from '@rhythm-ui/styles';

// Declare some css rules
createShadowStyles({
	RuiBreadcrumbs: css`
		a {
			color: rebeccapurple;
		}
	`,
	RuiButton: `
		a {
			color: green;
		}
	`
});

if (someCondition === true) {
	// Button's will now render as orange as previous RuiButton rules will now be overriden
	// However, RuiBreadcrumbs rules remain uneffected
	createShadowStyles({
		RuiButton: `
			a {
				color: orange;
			}
		`
	});
}
```

**What does calling createShadowStyles do?** It declares "additional css" for one or more components in a store. This is a way to "preserve" the styles and once 
the Web component is defined/ready Rhythm UI will auto inject the styles.

## Styling Tips

### Component-defined styles

Web components can style themselves too, by using the `:host` selector.

**Example** - a component styling itself

```js
createShadowStyles({
	RuiAlert: `
		:host {
			padding: 30px;
		}
	`
});
```

One gotcha with `:host` is that rules in the parent page have higher specificity than `:host` rules defined in the element. That is, outside styles win.

### Styling slotted nodes

`::slotted(<compound-selector>)` matches nodes that are distributed into a `<slot>`.

Let's say we've created a RuiRichText component:

```html
<rui-rich-text>
	<h1>Juicy</h1>
	<span class="subHeading">Digital Nomads</span>
</ui-rich-text>
```

The component's shadow DOM can style the user's `<h1>` and `.subHeading:`

```js
createShadowStyles({
	RuiRichText: `
		
		::slotted(h1) {
			color: green;
		}

		::slotted(.subHeading) {
			color: black;
		}

	`
});
```
