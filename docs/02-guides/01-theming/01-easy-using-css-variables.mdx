# Easy: Using CSS Variables

Using CSS Variables is by far the easiest way to make changes to components and should always be your starting point.

Rhythm UI remains largely unopinionted on how you do your own CSS be it inline, in a css file, css in js or from a pre-proccessor. 
As long as the CSS variables are defined on the page, Rhythm UI components will pick up your settings.

You will find the available CSS variables documented at the bottom of every component page.

So for example, we could set some variables on the Breadcrumbs component like this

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			/*
			* Customise breadcrumbs component
			*/
			--rui-breadcrumbs__separator-padding: 0 8px;
			--rui-breadcrumbs__separator-content: ">";
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<rui-breadcrumbs>
			<a href="/">Home</a>
			<a href="/about-us">About us</a>
		</rui-breadcrumbs>
	</body>
</html>
```
