# Using CSS Variables

This is by far the easiest way to make changes to components.

Rhythm UI remains largly unopinionted on how you do your own CSS be it inline, in a css file, css in js or from a pre-proccessor. As long as the CSS variables are defined
on the page, Rhythm UI components will pick up your settings.

Available CSS variables are documented at the bottom of every component page.

So for example, we could set come variables on the Breadcrumbs component like this

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			/*
			* Customise breadcrumbs component
			*/
			--rui-breadcrumbs__separator-padding: 0 8px;
			--rui-breadcrumbs__separator-content: ">";
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<rui-breadcrumbs>
			<a href="/">Home</a>
			<a href="/about-us">About us</a>
		</rui-breadcrumbs>
	</body>
</html>
```
