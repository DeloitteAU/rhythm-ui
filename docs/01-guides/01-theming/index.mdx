# Theming

Customise Rhythm UI components with your own branding & styles.

## For UI Designers

TODO

## For UI Developers

Rhythm UI styles and some markup are self-contained within the **shadow dom** of each component. This removes the brittleness that 
generally comes with global scoped html, css and js. It also means the components styles are only loaded when in use (which avoids dead code) 
which is good for performance.

We achieve this by using **web components** under the hood, if you are not familiar with them we suggest you read this [brief introduction](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction).

The technology that currently underpins all our web components is [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide) a framework by Google. While its useful to 
know *what* we are using, we have **encapsulated** in a way that allows us to change it in the future should we wish too. *Your theme should not depend on LitElement.*

### Styling

When it comes to customising our components you have a few options that each come with step up in complexity.

- **Easy** Use our predefined css variables - *Recommended*
- **Moderate** Use a hook to inject custom css into a components shadow dom
- **Advanced** Extend our components and override templates and methods
